Please run receive_udp_broadcast.lua on a WiFi device, 
you may also need to install (luarocks, dkjson, luasocket), 
this is important as you may encounter incorrect network configuration 
- see https://superuser.com/questions/1287485/udp-broadcasting-not-working-on-some-routers.

Run send_req_once.rb and check the previous device, if you get the packet - well done!
